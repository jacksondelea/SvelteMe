The video provides a demo of Mtriage, an open source software framework developed for the analysis of large volumes of video and images. I updated the code base, trained a new machine learning classifier to detect and classify objects in video and images, and produced and edited the video.",

      "info2": "Curatorial description: “Computer vision” is a field of computer science focused on identifying objects and aspects in images and videos. The field has been enriched in recent decades by significant advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which have sufficiently improved classification accuracy, facilitating  an expansion in the business of large-scale and real-time processing in industry, business, and military applications. Computational “eyes” are heralded as more efficient than human ones at scale, and even less “biased” (by some). ‘Mtriage’ is an open source software framework developed by Forensic Architecture to download, process and analyze media in order to expedite the investigation of human rights violations captured in public domain media.
